            I am a Computer Science graduate student at Portland State University. 
            Previously in my professional career, I started as an intern at Philips and worked at 
            companies like Cerner and ZOLL Medical corporation as a Software Engineer. 
            I was involved in all the aspects of software development from designing, developing, reviewing to unit testing. 
            It was mostly desktop applications like HIS (Hospital Information System) to interface with the medical equipment's. I have also touched upon some data processing and analysis using SDK’s and API’s. 
            My interests at Portland State have mainly been database/data, parallel computing and cloud technologies. 
            I have worked on some very intriguing projects for designing, building and maintaining data processing pipelines 
            for Portland's real time C-Tran data, developing serverless web applications and deploying them on cloud platforms 
            using docker containers, working on some basic parallel programming to achieve high performance by 
            running programs/apps simultaneously on different computers across a distributed memory.
